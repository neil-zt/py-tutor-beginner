Practice Exercise 6: Calculator App

Create a simple calculator application using functions:

1. `add(x, y)`: Adds two numbers and returns the result.
2. `subtract(x, y)`: Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.
3. `multiply(x, y)`: Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
4. `divide(x, y)`: Divides the first number by the second and returns the result.

Your program should:

1. Prompt the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /).
2. Call the appropriate function based on the chosen operation and display the result.
